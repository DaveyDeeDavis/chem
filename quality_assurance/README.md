Quality Assurance Documentation
===============================

`GlobalChem` and `GlobalChemExtensions` Test Documentation will be handled here in this README. Test infrastructure and possible future feature implementation should be logged here. When developing a feature. 
It is always appropiate before designing a feature is knowing how to test it.
