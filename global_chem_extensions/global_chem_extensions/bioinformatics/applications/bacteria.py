Bacterial Classifiers
Main phenotypic systems of classification
•	Classification based on composition of cell wall
o	Gram-Positive: contain one plasma membrane covered in a thick peptidoglycan cell wall
	Example: Staphylococcus (genus name)
o	Gram-Negative: Contain 2 membranes. An inner membrane that separates the cytoplasm from the periplasm and an outer membrane that separates the periplasm from the extracellular space. The outer membrane is covered by a lipopolysaccharide cell wall. Between the two membranes within the periplasm there is a thin peptidoglycan layer.
	Example: Pseudomonas (genus name)
•	Classification Based on Shape
o	Bacillus: Rod-Shaped
	Example: Escherichia coli (species name)
o	Spirilla or spirochete: spiral-shaped
	Example: Spirillum volutans (species name)
o	Coccus: Sphere-shaped
	Example: Streptococcus pneumoniae (species name)
o	Vibrio: Comma-shaped
	Vibrio cholerae (species name)
•	Classification based on mode of nutrition
o	Autotrophic bacteria: derive energy themselves from light or chemical reactions
	Photoautotrophs: Derive energy from light
•	Oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria: perform oxygenic photosynthesis to derive energy using H2O as the electron donor and produces oxygen
o	Example: Cyanobacteria (phylum name)
•	 Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria: Use H2S, H2 or thiosulfate as reducing agent and hydrogen sources to produce energy
o	Purple sulfur bacteria: Use H2S or thiosulphates as a reducing agent and release sulfur
	Examples: Chromatiaceae and Ectothiorhodospiraceae (These are the only 2 families of purple sulfur bacteria) 
o	Purple non-sulfur bacteria: Mainly use H2 as a reducing agent 
	Examples: All belong to the order Rhodospirillales
o	Green sulfur bacteria: use sulfide, H2, or Fe(II) as an electron donor.
	Examples: All belong to the Chlorobiaceae family
	Chemoautotrophs: Derive energy from inorganic oxidation
•	Sulfur bacteria: oxidize H2S or thiosulphates to molecular sulfur or sulphates.
o	Examples: Beggiatoa, Thiobacillus, Thiothrix, Sulfolobus (all are genus names)
•	Nitrogen bacteria: Nitrifying bacteria convert ammonia to nitrite or nitrite to nitrate to produce energy.
o	Examples: Nitrosomonas (genus name, converts ammonia to nitrite), Nitrobacter (genus name, converts nitrite to nitrate)
•	Hydrogen bacteria: Oxidize H2 to produce energy
o	Examples: Heliobacter pylori, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus, Hydrogenovibrio marinus (all are species names)
•	Methanotrophs: use methane as a carbon source and to derive energy
o	Examples: Methylomonas albis, Methylococcus capsulatus (species names)
•	Iron bacteria: Oxidize ferrous ions to ferric ions to produce energy
o	Examples: Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, Geobacter metallireducens (species names)
o	Heterotophic bacteria: Derive energy from organic compounds
	Parasitic bacteria: derive their food from living organisms, not all are pathogenic
•	Examples of pathogenic parasitic bacteria:
o	In plants: Xanthomonas axonopodis, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Xanthomonas campestris, Pseudomonas syringae, Pseudomonas solanacearum (all are species names)
o	In Humans: Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Clostridium tetani, Bordetella pertussis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (all are species names)
	Symbiotic bacteria: Live in a symbiotic association with other organisms
•	Examples: 
o	Plants: Rhizobium (genus, found in root nodules)
o	Animals:  Bacteroidetes (genus, found in gut microbiome)
	Saprophytic bacteria: Feed on dead or decaying organic matter. Break down complex organic matter into simple compounds and assimilate them.
•	Spirochaeta cytophaga
 
•	Classification based on mode of respiration
o	Aerobic bacteria: Produce more energy than anaerobic bacteria, uses molecular oxygen as the final electron acceptor.
	Obligate aerobes: Can only respire aerobically, requires oxygen to survive and are generally killed under anaerobic conditions
•	Example: Bacillus subtilis (species name)
	Facultative anaerobes: Generally respire anaerobically but can switch to anaerobic respiration if oxygen becomes deficient
•	Example: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (species name)
o	Anaerobic bacteria: Produce less energy than aerobic bacteria, uses CO2, sulfur, fumarate, or Fe(III) as the final electron acceptor
	Obligate anaerobes: Can only respire anaerobically and are generally killed under aerobic conditions
•	Example: Clostridium botulinum (species name)
	Facultative aerobes: Respire anaerobically under normal conditions but can respire aerobically when oxygen is available
•	Example: Escherichia coli (species name)
•	Example of phenotypic bacterial classification (this does not include all classifiers)
 
Other phenotypic methods of classification
•	Classification based on environmental reservoirs:
o	Endogenous reservoirs: found on or within the body
	Examples: Bacillota and Bacteroidota (genus names, found in the gut)
o	Exogenous reservoirs: found somewhere in the environment
	Vibrio cholerae (waterborne) and Salmonella enterica (foodborne) (species names)
•	Serologic systems for classification: 
o	Selected antisera can be used to classify different bacterial species. This may be based on either carbohydrate or protein antigens from the bacterial cell wall or the capsular polysaccharide. (Group A streptococcal M proteins or O and H polysaccharide antigens of salmonella).
Genotypic systems of classification
•	Universal Phylogenetic Tree:
o	Used for all living organisms that establishes a tripartite division of all living organisms, bacteria, archaea and eucarya (domains), based on a comparison of 16s ribosomal RNA sequences
Taxonomic hierarchy:
•	(least specific) Domain->Phylum->Class->Order->Family->Genus->Species
•	Specific example of Taxonomic classification (Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
o	Domain: Bacteria
o	Phylum: Pseudomonadota
o	Class: Gammaproteobacteria
o	Order: Pseudomonadales
o	Family:	Pseudomonadaceae
o	Genus:	Pseudomonas
o	Species: P. aeruginosa
