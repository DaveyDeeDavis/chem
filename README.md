Adding Your Own Chemical List
=============================

If you would like to add your paper or a list you constructed to the chemical knowledge graph then please "File an Issue" with your chemical list 
and perhaps a suggestion of where to add it or you can leave for up to us to decide. The format of the chemical list can
be something like this, and we the community will elect it into the graph and add a couple of representative compounds to the forcefield:

```

smiles = {
   '3,5-dimethoxyphenylisoproxycarbonyl': 'COC1=CC(C(C)(OC=O)C)=CC(OC)=C1',
   '2-(4-biphenyl)isopropoxycarbonyl': 'CC(C)(OC=O)C(C=C1)=CC=C1C2=CC=CC=C2',
   '2-nitrophenylsulfenyl': 'SC1=CC=CC=C1[N+]([O-])=O',
   'boc': 'O=COC(C)(C)C',
}  

```
